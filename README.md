To view the interactive Swagger documentation, open the [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) and select `File > Import File > swagger.yaml`, or just copy/paste the contents of `swagger.yaml` into the editor. You will see the generated documentation on the right side of the screen. To generate the flask server skeleton, select `Generate Server > python-flask` in the editor. This will download all required files in a zip. For details of the yaml specification syntax, please see the documentation [here](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md). **Note that we are using Swagger v2.0**.
